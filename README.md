This is a mock up for the Horiseon company's homepage.

Web accessibility has been improved by utilizing appropriate HTML tags.
These tags are beneficial for users using screen readers, and provides 
a greater level of search optimization. 

The CSS stylesheet has been simplified by reducing redundant classes.

The Hero image was changed to include an overlay. 

These changes increase the usability of the site without comprimising 
the goals of the design team.
